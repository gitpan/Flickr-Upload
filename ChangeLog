Commit: cpb <cpb@earth.localdomain>

    <sigh> CPAN doesn't like it when you remove the $VERSION from a module.
    So we'll just revert the whole "move into Makefile.PL" thing.

    *: straight and async uploading via =flickr_upload= _works_

    passing, although the progress test is still uploading the image.

Commit: cpb <cpb>

    *: clean up preview a bit. Now properly scales images to fit, manages
    memory better, etc.
    *: make preview area a drag and drop site for photos. DnD code is a little
    crufty but works
    *: update menus a touch. Help is actually in the right place
    *: switch to messageBox for Help|About
    *: documentation
    *: use Tk::HTML::IO to, hopefully, do better IO for the upload. Haven't
    tested this and need to refine the upload process some anyways. We really
    want something like an "upload manager" view of what's happening.
    *: new photos are added at the front of the list. Just better feedback.

    Another Michael, another bug report...
    
    _Michael Parker says:_
    
    I noticed this in the flickr_upload script distributed with the
    Flickr::Upload package (at least until 1.10):
    
       'public=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },
       'friend=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },
       'family=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },
    
    It looks like a cut and paste error, using is_public for all 3 rather
    than is_friend and is_family.

Author: cpb <cpb>
Commit: cpb <cpb>

    *: added make_upload_request and upload_request functions to allow for more
    direct manipulation of the HTTP::Request structure.
    
    *: added t/request.t to demonstrate how said functionality can be used to
    upload images directly from memory rather than having to create temporary
    files. It appears, unfortunately, that LWP doesn't like the way I do
    things, but it only complains rather than bailing. The end result works.
