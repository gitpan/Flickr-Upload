	* Upload.pm (1.10):

	bump version number

2004-12-14 18:03  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.7):

	Grrr... forgot the perl version dependency in Makefile.PL...

2004-12-14 00:38  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.9):

	Michael Stillwell pointed out that the restriction to perl >= 5.8.3
	was silly. 5.6.1+ would be fine, and probably even earlier.

2004-12-08 01:03  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.6):

	oops, not -no-wrap

2004-12-08 01:01  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.5):

	Fixup the cvs2cl.pl options to something a bit nicer.

2004-12-07 03:45  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.4):

	add some Makefile.PL magic to ensure that ChangeLog is removed by
	make clean and generated by make dist. Of course, we're building
	dist with access to my CVS repository...

2004-12-05 17:27  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.6), t/progress.t (1.1):

	Add an example/test which uses the DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD
	functionality to implement some progress feedback.

2004-12-05 17:17  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.8):

	minor formatting tweak, but I also need to bump the version to do a
	new release.

2004-12-05 17:17  cpb

	* t/: request.t (1.4), upload.t (1.8):

	*: HACK for the LWP content length warning. Apparently, add_parts()
	doesn't cause the existing content length to be invalidated and LWP
	complains when it recalculates it anyways.

	*: tweak description... sometimes the :: doesn't make it through.

2004-12-05 16:58  cpb

	* t/: request.t (1.3), upload.t (1.7):

	*: oops, chomp the password

	*: make test image private. We don't really need to spam the tag
	index with kernel and perl over and over again...

2004-12-05 16:44  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.7), request.t (1.2), upload.t (1.6):

	make tests fail gracefully if no password file provided. This way I
	can do sane testing but cpansmoke won't complain.

2004-12-05 05:12  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.5), Upload.pm (1.7), t/request.t (1.1):

	*: added make_upload_request and upload_request functions to allow
	for more direct manipulation of the HTTP::Request structure.

	*: added t/request.t to demonstrate how said functionality can be
	used to upload images directly from memory rather than having to
	create temporary files. It appears, unfortunately, that LWP doesn't
	like the way I do things, but it only complains rather than
	bailing. The end result works.

2004-12-05 03:36  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.6), upload.t (1.5):

	strip out the test comments

2004-09-05 19:18  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.6):

	*: don't export upload() by default.  *: upload() returns the
	resulting photo identifier on success (still undef on failure).
	We're also nicer about the resulting failure message.

2004-09-05 19:17  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.3):

	*: output uploaded photoid for each image *: read config from
	~/.flickrrc.

2004-09-05 19:16  cpb

	* t/failupload.t (1.5):

	in theory, zero might be a valid photoid. Probably not, but...

2004-09-05 19:16  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.4), upload.t (1.4):

	change how we 'use' the module.

2004-09-04 22:33  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.5):

	force version increment

2004-09-04 22:33  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.3), README (1.2):

	assorted documentation niceties. Dunno how I forgot about the
	README...

2004-09-04 20:29  cpb

	* META.yml (1.2[DEAD]):

	remove META.yml from CVS

2004-09-04 20:29  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.2):

	- assorted pod additions - cleanup failure handling

2004-09-04 20:10  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.4), Makefile.PL (1.2), flickr_upload (1.1):

	- added flickr_upload script - clean up Makefile.PL (i.e. add
	prereqs, etc).

2004-09-04 20:09  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.3), upload.t (1.3):

	tags now just a string rather than list ref

2004-09-04 20:09  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.4):

	assorted fixes: - pod fixes - tags now just a string rather than a
	list ref

2004-09-04 18:03  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.3), t/failupload.t (1.2), t/upload.t (1.2):

	upload() works

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.3):

	change tests

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* t/: Flickr-Upload.t (1.2[DEAD]), Kernel & perl.jpg (1.1),
	failupload.t (1.1), upload.t (1.1):

	adjusted testing, added test image

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.2):

	laid out pod, initial stab at how API will work

2004-09-02 21:43  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.2), META.yml (1.1):

	added META.yml

2004-09-02 21:34  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.1), Makefile.PL (1.1), README (1.1), Upload.pm (1.1),
	t/Flickr-Upload.t (1.1):

	Initial revision

2004-09-02 21:34  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.1.1.1), Makefile.PL (1.1.1.1), README (1.1.1.1),
	Upload.pm (1.1.1.1), t/Flickr-Upload.t (1.1.1.1):
