	* MANIFEST (1.11), t/Kernel & perl.jpg (1.2[DEAD]), t/async.t
	  (1.3), t/failupload.t (1.9), t/progress.t (1.4), t/request.t
	  (1.6), t/testimage.jpg (1.1), t/upload.t (1.10):

	change the test image name. Needs to go in MANIFEST...

2005-08-28 01:05  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.9):

	(#11) key and secret can be specified in =~/.flickrrc=. This allows a user to get one
	API key, authenticate against it, and use =flickr_upload= and a bunch of personal
	scripts with just =~/.flickrc= for storing the authentication info.

2005-08-28 00:59  cpb

	* README (1.6), Upload.pm (1.22):

	(#11) change of ownership

2005-08-28 00:35  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.21), flickr_upload (1.8):

	(#11) some documentation cleanups

2005-08-24 02:36  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.12), README (1.5):

	(#8) really remove refs to =thickr_upload=.

2005-08-24 02:32  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.11):

	(#8) switched to Debian, =cvs2cl= is called something else

2005-08-24 02:31  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.20):

	(#8) remove some debug code, handle undef photo situation.

2005-08-24 02:29  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.10), Upload.pm (1.19), flickr_upload (1.7),
	  thickr_upload (1.3), t/async.t (1.2), t/failupload.t (1.8),
	  t/progress.t (1.3), t/request.t (1.5), t/upload.t (1.9):

	(#8) first stab at getting =Flickr::Upload= working with the new authentication.

	*: had to completely gut the interface and inherit from =Flickr::API=.
	*: straight and async uploading via =flickr_upload= _works_
	*: this means =Flickr::Upload::upload()= and =Flickr::Upload::check_upload()= methods
	are good.
	*: tests /Flickr-Upload/t/request.t and /Flickr-Upload/t/progress.t are _not_
	passing, although the progress test is still uploading the image.

2005-08-24 01:57  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.10):

	(#8) remove =thickr_upload= for now.

2005-03-16 02:31  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.18):

	bump version

2005-02-16 03:16  cpb

	* thickr_upload (1.2):

	non-blocking uploading...

	*: spawn the uploading in a separate process (via fork) and process the
	results in a pipe using Tk fileevent.
	*: error handling needs a bit of work
	*: need to manage the process id of the uploader so that we clean up when
	we quit.
	*: really need an upload manager window so we can monitor the entire queue
	*: also need to check for ticket completions

2005-02-06 15:09  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.9):

	tweak ChangeLog options

2005-02-05 23:40  cpb

	* README (1.4):

	add blurb about thickr_upload

2005-02-05 23:38  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.9), Makefile.PL (1.8), thickr_upload (1.1),
	  thkr_upload (1.7[DEAD]):

	rename thkr_upload to thickr_upload. Long story, won't bother explaining.

2005-02-05 23:35  cpb

	* thkr_upload (1.6):

	remove the logo stuff. We'll just show some blankness.

2005-02-05 23:16  cpb

	* thkr_upload (1.5):

	*: remove some debug junk
	*: replace Tk::FileSelect with Tk::getOpenFile() so we can do multiple
	selection. This really streamlines things.

2005-02-05 21:11  cpb

	* thkr_upload (1.4):

	fix comment about best way to use LWP from Tk

2005-01-17 04:03  cpb

	* thkr_upload (1.3):

	more churning on the uploading. Nicer cleanup.

2005-01-16 04:50  cpb

	* thkr_upload (1.2):

	*: clean up preview a bit. Now properly scales images to fit, manages
	memory better, etc.
	*: make preview area a drag and drop site for photos. DnD code is a little
	crufty but works
	*: update menus a touch. Help is actually in the right place
	*: switch to messageBox for Help|About
	*: documentation
	*: use Tk::HTML::IO to, hopefully, do better IO for the upload. Haven't
	tested this and need to refine the upload process some anyways. We really
	want something like an "upload manager" view of what's happening.
	*: new photos are added at the front of the list. Just better feedback.

2005-01-15 05:08  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.8), Upload.pm (1.17), flickr_logo_beta.gif (1.1),
	  thkr_upload (1.1):

	added initial cut at thkr_upload, a Tk-based GUI upload client

2005-01-13 14:33  cpb

	* README (1.3), Upload.pm (1.16):

	update documentation a touch. It's a new year, you know.

2005-01-13 14:31  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.15):

	$VERSION++

2005-01-13 14:31  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.6):

	use the async option to pipeline the upload process so we wait for photoid
	assignments after _all_ the uploads are completed. This should reduce the
	overall time are multi-image batch uploads quite a bit.

2005-01-13 14:16  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.7):

	added async.t to MANIFEST

2005-01-13 04:28  cpb

	* t/progress.t (1.2):

	chunk could be undefined.

2005-01-13 04:23  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.14), t/async.t (1.1):

	*: modified make_upload_request() to allow async and properly handle
	returned ticket ids.

	*: added check_upload() function to check status up async tickets

	*: added t/async.t to test/demo async functionality

2005-01-08 17:13  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.13):

	trim down commentary on async uploading. It _might_ be useful to such an
	API, given recent problems with delays in the uploading process (in
	something like sync conduits, for example).

2005-01-08 17:06  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.12), flickr_upload (1.5):

	L<> in NAME section gets interpreted as links to a man page, leading to a
	synopsis like "Flickr::Upload - Upload images to the flickr.com manpage".

2005-01-04 00:37  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.11):

	version++

2005-01-04 00:36  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.4):

	Another Michael, another bug report...

	_Michael Parker says:_

	I noticed this in the flickr_upload script distributed with the
	Flickr::Upload package (at least until 1.10):

	   'public=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },
	   'friend=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },
	   'family=i' => sub { $args{is_public} = $_[1] },

	It looks like a cut and paste error, using is_public for all 3 rather
	than is_friend and is_family.

2004-12-14 18:03  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.10):

	bump version number

2004-12-14 18:03  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.7):

	Grrr... forgot the perl version dependency in Makefile.PL...

2004-12-14 00:38  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.9):

	Michael Stillwell pointed out that the restriction to perl >= 5.8.3 was
	silly. 5.6.1+ would be fine, and probably even earlier.

2004-12-08 01:03  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.6):

	oops, not -no-wrap

2004-12-08 01:01  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.5):

	Fixup the cvs2cl.pl options to something a bit nicer.

2004-12-07 03:45  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.4):

	add some Makefile.PL magic to ensure that ChangeLog is removed by make
	clean and generated by make dist. Of course, we're building dist with
	access to my CVS repository...

2004-12-05 17:27  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.6), t/progress.t (1.1):

	Add an example/test which uses the DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD functionality to
	implement some progress feedback.

2004-12-05 17:17  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.8):

	minor formatting tweak, but I also need to bump the version to do a new
	release.

2004-12-05 17:17  cpb

	* t/: request.t (1.4), upload.t (1.8):

	*: HACK for the LWP content length warning. Apparently, add_parts() doesn't
	cause the existing content length to be invalidated and LWP complains
	when it recalculates it anyways.

	*: tweak description... sometimes the :: doesn't make it through.

2004-12-05 16:58  cpb

	* t/: request.t (1.3), upload.t (1.7):

	*: oops, chomp the password

	*: make test image private. We don't really need to spam the tag index with
	kernel and perl over and over again...

2004-12-05 16:44  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.7), request.t (1.2), upload.t (1.6):

	make tests fail gracefully if no password file provided. This way I can do
	sane testing but cpansmoke won't complain.

2004-12-05 05:12  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.5), Upload.pm (1.7), t/request.t (1.1):

	*: added make_upload_request and upload_request functions to allow for more
	direct manipulation of the HTTP::Request structure.

	*: added t/request.t to demonstrate how said functionality can be used to
	upload images directly from memory rather than having to create temporary
	files. It appears, unfortunately, that LWP doesn't like the way I do
	things, but it only complains rather than bailing. The end result works.

2004-12-05 03:36  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.6), upload.t (1.5):

	strip out the test comments

2004-09-05 19:18  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.6):

	*: don't export upload() by default.
	*: upload() returns the resulting photo identifier on success (still undef
	on failure). We're also nicer about the resulting failure message.

2004-09-05 19:17  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.3):

	*: output uploaded photoid for each image
	*: read config from ~/.flickrrc.

2004-09-05 19:16  cpb

	* t/failupload.t (1.5):

	in theory, zero might be a valid photoid. Probably not, but...

2004-09-05 19:16  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.4), upload.t (1.4):

	change how we 'use' the module.

2004-09-04 22:33  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.5):

	force version increment

2004-09-04 22:33  cpb

	* Makefile.PL (1.3), README (1.2):

	assorted documentation niceties. Dunno how I forgot about the README...

2004-09-04 20:29  cpb

	* META.yml (1.2[DEAD]):

	remove META.yml from CVS

2004-09-04 20:29  cpb

	* flickr_upload (1.2):

	- assorted pod additions
	- cleanup failure handling

2004-09-04 20:10  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.4), Makefile.PL (1.2), flickr_upload (1.1):

	- added flickr_upload script
	- clean up Makefile.PL (i.e. add prereqs, etc).

2004-09-04 20:09  cpb

	* t/: failupload.t (1.3), upload.t (1.3):

	tags now just a string rather than list ref

2004-09-04 20:09  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.4):

	assorted fixes:
	- pod fixes
	- tags now just a string rather than a list ref

2004-09-04 18:03  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.3), t/failupload.t (1.2), t/upload.t (1.2):

	upload() works

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.3):

	change tests

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* t/: Flickr-Upload.t (1.2[DEAD]), Kernel & perl.jpg (1.1),
	  failupload.t (1.1), upload.t (1.1):

	adjusted testing, added test image

2004-09-04 15:49  cpb

	* Upload.pm (1.2):

	laid out pod, initial stab at how API will work

2004-09-02 21:43  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.2), META.yml (1.1):

	added META.yml

2004-09-02 21:34  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.1), Makefile.PL (1.1), README (1.1), Upload.pm (1.1),
	  t/Flickr-Upload.t (1.1):

	Initial revision

2004-09-02 21:34  cpb

	* MANIFEST (1.1.1.1), Makefile.PL (1.1.1.1), README (1.1.1.1),
	  Upload.pm (1.1.1.1), t/Flickr-Upload.t (1.1.1.1):

	initial import
