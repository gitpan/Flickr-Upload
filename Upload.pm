=head1 NAME

Flickr::Upload - Upload images to L<flickr.com>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use LWP::UserAgent;
	use Flickr::Upload qw(upload);

	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
	upload(
		$ua,
		'photo' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
	) or die "Failed to upload /tmp/image.jpg";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Upload an image to L<flickr.com>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 upload

	my $photoid = upload(
		$ua,
		'photo' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
	);

Taking a L<LWP::UserAgent> as an argument (C<$ua>), this is basically a
direct interface to the Flickr Photo Upload API. Required parameters are
C<photo>, C<email>, and C<password>. C<uri> may be provided if you don't
want to use the default, L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_go.gne>
(i.e. you have a custom server running somewhere that supports the API).

Returns the resulting identifier of the uploaded photo on success,
C<undef> on failure. According to the API documentation, after an upload the
user should be directed to the page
L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_edit.gne?ids=$photoid>.

sub upload($%) {
	my $ua = shift;
	die "expecting a LWP::UserAgent" unless $ua->isa('LWP::UserAgent');
	my %args = @_;

	# these are the only things _required_ by the uploader.
	return undef unless $args{'photo'} and -f $args{'photo'};
	return undef unless $args{'email'};
	return undef unless $args{'password'};

	# create a request object and execute it
	my $req = make_upload_request( %args );
	return undef unless defined $req;

	return upload_request( $ua, $req );
}

=head2 make_upload_request

	my $req = make_upload_request(
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
	);
	$req->header( 'X-Greetz' => 'hi cal' );
	my $resp = $ua->request( $req );

Creates an L<HTTP::Request> object loaded with all the flick upload
parameters.

Takes all the same parameters as L<upload>, except that the photo argument
isn't required. This in intended so that the caller can include it by
messing directly with the HTTP content (via C<$DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD> or
the L<HTTP::Message> class, among other things).

Returns a standard L<HTTP::Response> POST object. The caller can manually
do the upload or just call the L<upload_request> function.

sub make_upload_request(%) {
	my %args = @_;

	# these are the only things _required_ by the uploader.
	return undef unless $args{'email'};
	return undef unless $args{'password'};

	my $uri = $args{'uri'} || 'http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_go.gne';

	# passed in separately, so remove from the hash
	delete $args{uri};

	# we don't do async
	$args{async} = 0;

	if( exists $args{photo} and ref $args{photo} ne "ARRAY" ) {
		# unlikely that the caller would set up the photo as an array,
		# but...
		$args{photo} = [ $args{photo} ];
	}

	return POST $uri, 'Content_Type' => 'form-data', 'Content' => \%args;
}

=head2 upload_request

	my $photoid = upload_request( $ua, $request );

Taking L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<HTTP::Request> objects as arguments, this
executes the request and processes the result as a flickr upload. It's
assumed that the request looks a lot like something created with
L<make_upload_request>.

Returns the resulting identifier of the uploaded photo on success,
C<undef> on failure. According to the API documentation, after an upload the
user should be directed to the page
L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_edit.gne?ids=$photoid>.

=head1 BUGS

Asynchronous uploading isn't supported. Async, quite frankly, doesn't
make much sense in this API. Anyone who can write a perl script to get
an image upload going but is unable to keep track of whether or not it
finished without polling a web server has got major problems.
