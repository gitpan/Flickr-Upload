=head1 NAME

Flickr::Upload - Upload images to C<flickr.com>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use LWP::UserAgent;
	use Flickr::Upload qw(upload);

	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
	upload(
		$ua,
		'photo' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
	) or die "Failed to upload /tmp/image.jpg";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Upload an image to L<flickr.com>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 upload

	my $photoid = upload(
		$ua,
		'photo' => '/tmp/image.jpg',
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
		'async' => 0,
	);

Taking a L<LWP::UserAgent> as an argument (C<$ua>), this is basically a
direct interface to the Flickr Photo Upload API. Required parameters are
C<photo>, C<email>, and C<password>. C<uri> may be provided if you don't
want to use the default, L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_go.gne>
(i.e. you have a custom server running somewhere that supports the API).

Returns the resulting identifier of the uploaded photo on success,
C<undef> on failure. According to the API documentation, after an upload the
user should be directed to the page
L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_edit.gne?ids=$photoid>.

If the C<async> option is non-zero, the photo will be uploaded
asynchronously and a successful upload returns a ticket number. See
L<http://flickr.com/services/api/upload.async.html>. The caller can then
periodically poll for a photo id using the C<check_upload> call.

sub upload($%) {
	my $ua = shift;
	die "expecting a LWP::UserAgent" unless $ua->isa('LWP::UserAgent');
	my %args = @_;

	# these are the only things _required_ by the uploader.
	return undef unless $args{'photo'} and -f $args{'photo'};
	return undef unless $args{'email'};
	return undef unless $args{'password'};

	# create a request object and execute it
	my $req = make_upload_request( %args );
	return undef unless defined $req;

	return upload_request( $ua, $req );
}

=head2 check_upload

	my %status2txt = (0 => 'not complete', 1 => 'completed', 2 => 'failed');
	my @rc = check_upload( $ua, @ticketids );
	for( @rc ) {
		print "Ticket $_->{id} has $status2txt{$_->{complete}}\n";
		print "\tPhoto id is $_->{photoid}\n" if exists $_->{photoid};
	}

This function will check the status of one or more asynchronous uploads. A
list of ticket identifiers are provided (C<@ticketids>) and each is
checked.

On success, a list of hash references is returned. Each
hash contains a C<id> (the ticket id), C<complete> and, if
completed, C<photoid> members. C<invalid> may also be returned.
Status codes (for C<complete>) are as documented at
L<http://flickr.com/services/api/upload.async.html> and, actually, the
returned fields are identical to those listed in the C<ticket> tag of the
response.  The returned list isn't guaranteed to be in any particular order.

This function polls a web server, so avoid calling it too frequently.

=head2 make_upload_request

	my $req = make_upload_request(
		'email' => 'self@example.com',
		'password' => 'pr1vat3',
		'tags' => 'me myself eye',
		'is_public' => 1,
		'is_friend' => 1,
		'is_family' => 1
	);
	$req->header( 'X-Greetz' => 'hi cal' );
	my $resp = $ua->request( $req );

Creates an L<HTTP::Request> object loaded with all the flick upload
parameters.

Takes all the same parameters as L<upload>, except that the photo argument
isn't required. This in intended so that the caller can include it by
messing directly with the HTTP content (via C<$DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD> or
the L<HTTP::Message> class, among other things). See C<t/> directory from
the source distribution for examples.

Returns a standard L<HTTP::Response> POST object. The caller can manually
do the upload or just call the L<upload_request> function.

sub make_upload_request(%) {

	# these are the only things _required_ by the uploader.
	return undef unless $args{'email'};
	return undef unless $args{'password'};

	my $uri = $args{'uri'} || 'http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_go.gne';

	# passed in separately, so remove from the hash
	delete $args{uri};

	if( exists $args{photo} and ref $args{photo} ne "ARRAY" ) {
		# unlikely that the caller would set up the photo as an array,
		# but...
		$args{photo} = [ $args{photo} ];
	}

	return POST $uri, 'Content_Type' => 'form-data', 'Content' => \%args;
}

=head2 upload_request

	my $photoid = upload_request( $ua, $request );

Taking L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<HTTP::Request> objects as arguments, this
executes the request and processes the result as a flickr upload. It's
assumed that the request looks a lot like something created with
L<make_upload_request>.

Returns the resulting identifier of the uploaded photo (or ticket for
asynchronous uploads) on success, C<undef> on failure. According to the
API documentation, after an upload the user should be directed to the
page L<http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_edit.gne?ids=$photoid>.
